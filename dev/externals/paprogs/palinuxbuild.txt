palinuxbuild.txt:

Portaudio is required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs).
If the required libportaudio.a is not detected, the top level build script 
(makeprograms.sh)  will skip this stage.

The audio program makefiles assume availability and use of both alsa and jack.

The supplied source archive is the latest v19 stable release 2014.

To build, unpack pa--tgz in situ; this will create a portaudio directory. 
Run configure with these options:

./configure --with-alsa --with-jack

Then run make as usual to build, 

Do not perform run 'make install' unless you are happy for it to replace your current system portaudio libs.

The CDP makefiles look for the local lib/.libs folder for libportaudio.a

To build the audio programs, either:

run the Makefile in each program directory:

make install -f Makefile.linux

or run the top level makeprograms.sh script.

NB "install" above merely copies the binaries into the local Release directory under dev/.
