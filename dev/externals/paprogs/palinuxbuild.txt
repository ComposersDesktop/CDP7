palinuxbuild.txt:

Portaudio is required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs).


The audio program CMake makefiles assume availability and use of both alsa and jack.

The supplied source archive is the latest v19 stable release 2014.

To build, unpack pa--tgz in situ; this will create a portaudio directory. The CDP GitHub archive includes
an already-expanded (and slightly modified) portaudio directory. 
This can safely be deleted, as it is required only for Windows/Mingw.
 
Run configure with these options:

./configure --with-alsa --with-jack

Then run make as usual to build, 

Do not perform run 'make install' unless you are happy for it to replace your current system portaudio libs.

The CDP makefiles look for the local lib/.libs folder for libportaudio.a

Addendum 18-10-2021

A new "stable" distribution of portaudio is now available, which promises full CMake support. We are
watching reports of this version carefully, and will expect to update these build instructions in due course.
