How to buld Portaudio static library for Windows, using MinGW. 

This is required by the audio programs (paplay, pvplay, recsf, listaudevs)

This assumes MinGW is already installed. This has been developed using the standard MinGW distribution; it has not been tested with the 
Either or both ASIO and Directx support is needed for building the programs.

An unpacked portaudio folder is provided, based on the latest release
(see http://www.portaudio.com). It has a modified configure.in file to plug gaps in the default 
portaudio configure setup.


1. If ASIO support is desired, obtain the SDK from the Steinberg site (we are not allowed to distribute it ourselves).
See: http://www.steinberg.net/en/company/developer.html

It is convenient to put the unpacked directory ASIOSDK2 inside the portaudio folder, for ease of reference,
and especially if it is shared with other projects, but other locations are possible, including /usr/local. 
See the web page referenced at the bottom of this document.

2. DirectSound support

Unzip dx9mgw.zip into (e.g.) your MinGW home directory. This is the location assumed in the following instructions.

Source of this sdk: http://alleg.sourceforge.net/files/dx9mgw.zip
(see https://www.allegro.cc/forums/thread/610763)

These examples assume the user name is "Richard". of course, replace this as needed with your MinGW user name
 
Portaudio configure has to be told which APIs to activate, and the paths to the SDKs for those APIs.

cd to the portaudio directory (inside dev/externals/paprogs)

ASIO only configure (NB long lines here):

$ ./configure --with-host_os=mingw --with-winapi=asio --without-jack --enable-shared=no --enable-debug-output=no --with-asiodir=./ASIOSDK2


dsound only configure:

$ ./configure --with-host_os=mingw --with-winapi=directx --without-jack --enable-shared=no --enable-debug-output=no --with-dxdir=/home/Richard/dx9mgw 


Both (recommended):

$ ./configure --with-host_os=mingw --with-winapi=directx,asio --without-jack --enable-shared=no --enable-debug-output=no --with-dxdir=/home/Richard/dx9mgw --with-asiodir=./ASIOSDK2

Thjis generates the Makefile which we will use to build portaudio

3. Modify the Makefile

Add the define -DPAWIN_USE_WDMKS_DEVICE_INFO to CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS

Add the object file src/os/win/pa_win_wdmks_utils.o  to the OTHER_OJBJS list


The standard configure does not set up the exact combination we need, for multichannel device support.



And finally:

$ make

Note: only the static library libportaudio.a is built.
The makefiles for the audio programs look for this in the local hidden directory (lib/.libs).
There is no need to run [sudo] make install, which would overwrite any existing copy.
