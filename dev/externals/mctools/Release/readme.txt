CDP Multi-Channel Toolkit
Major update November 2009

This incremental update March 2012.

Changes in this version:

Programs now accept ill-formed WAVE files with bloated fmt chunk (e.g. as made by Pro Tools).

paplay:  uses latest stable release of Portaudio. Larger internal buffer to improve handling of 96KHz files.
chorder: corrected behaviour with out of range order chars, removed spurious usage message
interlx: corrected usage message to refer to outfile
njoin:   can now handle large filelist
abfpan:  corrected usage message re -b and -x
copysfx: corrected handling of wavex format options



General.

These programs are free to all users. They are designed to simplify
many of the housekeeping tasks involved in multi-channel 
audio in general, and Ambisonic B-Format production in particular.

This is a fairly substantial update (the last one was back in 2006),
with a number of new programs. I will respond as promptly as
possible to all bug reports and feature requests, but cannot
promise that future updates on this scale will appear after a 
shorter interval.

These programs are also supplied with the full CDP system 
(http://www.composersdesktop.com), and are therefore included in 
the support we offer to all CDP users.


Donations.

I have had the occasional inquiry regarding paid support options 
for the Toolkit alone, where it is being used in companies, or by 
individuals as part of their work. Rather than decide, somewhat 
arbitrarily, on a formal support package, I invite modest donations via 
Paypal from anyone so inclined, who has found the Toolkit valuable 
to their work. See the Toolkit web page for details. Donations will 
not only be much appreciated in themselves; they will also be most 
encouraging with respect to future enhancements and developments!
